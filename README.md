### About the App

The application is a the result of a student course project at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. 

Latest release on Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lahimatkailu.

The app has been developed for Android using React Native with Redux and Redux Thunk.

#### Description

The app is a tool for planning day tours to Finnish nature sites and outdoor attractions. Sites can be viewed on a map and searched by name.

The app has three navigable pages: a main page (or map page), a search page and a settings page. In addition, there is a site information page, which is an overlay page that can open on top of either the map page or the search page. 

The map page shows sites and their types, signified by different icons. The three types are sight, service and food. Clicking a site icon on the map opens a callout box that shows some basic information about the particular site (name, type, distance, whether/until when it is open). Clicking the callout box opens a site information page showing more detailed information about the particular site (address, description, opening hours and links (homepage, social media, navigation to destination with Google Maps)). The information page is also available through the search page.

The search page features a search bar, search filters and search results as a list. The results can be filtered by site type as well as by distance from the user's device (e.g., only show results between 0 and 30 kilometers). The results in the list view show site type, name and address. Clicking a list item opens a similar site information page as clicking a callout on the map page. Thus, two information pages can be open simultaneously (one on the map page and the other on the search page).

On the settings page, the user can change the language of the user interface. The app is available in four languages: Finnish, English, Swedish and Russian. In addition, the settings page features descriptions of all the icons used in the app.
